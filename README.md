SenseOpenH264
=============
This is the OpenH264 code for linux which is used for the needs of the SeNSE project.
In order to be able to run or debug the project, the conf files should be used (added in the command line input of the project -if the Eclipse enviroment is used)
Some folders mentioned in the conf files do not exist -at the time- in this repository and should be added localy.
